## Summary

Frontend Developer of 13 years turned Fullstack when Node.JS exploded in popularity. Specializing in converting legacy systems/apps to modern toolsets and practices, as well as full rebuilds when a new architecture is wanted. Currently thinking very seriously about creating a new UI language that brings concepts like reactivity and state management flows similar to mobx or redux into the core (RIP to my free time if I decide to do this).
