## Summary

Frontend Developer of 13 years turned Fullstack when Node.JS exploded in popularity. Specializing in converting legacy systems/apps to modern toolsets and practices, as well as full rebuilds when a new architecture is wanted. Currently thinking very seriously about creating a new UI language that brings concepts like reactivity and state management flows similar to mobx or redux into the core (RIP to my free time if I decide to do this).

> Jon is a highly skilled developer with a unique capacity to cut through noise and identify an optimal path to a technical solution. He is consistent in his output, and can be relied upon to produce at a steady, predictable pace. This is in regards to not only his work ethic, but also his ability to move through previously un-encountered technical challenges. Give Jon a codebase in which he has not previously worked, and he will sort it out and be producing with it in very short order. He is very aware of current and emerging technologies, but applies them to solutions in a sensible manner (rather than using personal interest as a primary motivator). -- <cite>Nick Hendricks - PigKnows</cite>
> Jon is one of the best developers I had pleasure to work with. He is passionate about what he is doing and never cuts corners. Never afraid to raise his concerns and propose the best solution for given problem. I have learned a lot from him and think he is going to be a great addition to any team. -- <cite>Yury Katko - Siemens</cite>
> Itâ€™s rare that you come across standout talent and mind like Jon&#x27;s. I hired Jon as a front end web developer and he is quite skilled in this area. Jon always has a handle on the latest available technologies and tools and went beyond his role as developer to also help out other team members with other aspects of our tech stack outside the front end web application development arena. He is also masterful with git version control tools, which helped a lot as our project was ramping up and we were creating the internal tools and processes to get things done. Jon is punctual and reliable too. Jon would be good on any web app team. -- <cite>Corky Kaericher - Socialtopias</cite>
