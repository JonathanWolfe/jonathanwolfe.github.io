        "brief": "Originally from Greenville, SC and then Charlotte, NC, Jon has spent a lot of time moving around the Carolinas. He obtained a degree in Social Psychology while at Appalachian State University. Jon got his start in web development early on in his life during middle school and has continued that ever since. When he's not programming for a client or making a small tool for himself or his friends, he can usually be found enjoying a book, manga, movie, or anime (that is if he's not playing a video game with his friends)."
