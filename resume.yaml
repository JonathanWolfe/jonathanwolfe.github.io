  summary: "Over more than a dozen years as a developer, I've grown from a PSD slicer, to a static site developer, to building CMS templates, to a dedicated Frontend Developer, and now a fullstack developer. I've watched the web as an industry grow and mature from Java Applets, then to PHP & jQuery, next the MVC framework explosion, and now the meta-framework era. With each turn of the ages, I grew and evolved alongside the industry, making sure I was always riding the most-likely big waves and learning not just how a singular library or framework worked, but how they were built and how the underlying fundamentals interacted to create the interactions and patterns we used. \n\n I see myself currently as someone who strives to create software that brings direct value to users, and does so while being built on patterns and systems that should let the software outlive me. I've spent a majority of the second half of my career moving legacy systems over to modern toolsets, leading projects to help scale systems to new orders of magnitude, and creating tooling that brings more speed and reliability to developers and companies."

He is a strong advocate for well-organized and clean code, and supports his peers in meeting those standards. I appreciate the time time we spent working together and would be happy to work with him again in the future.'
  - name: 'Nick Hendricks - System Administrator - PigKnows'
    reference: 'Jon is a highly skilled developer with a unique capacity to cut through noise and identify an optimal path to a technical solution. He is consistent in his output, and can be relied upon to produce at a steady, predictable pace. This is in regards to not only his work ethic, but also his ability to move through previously un-encountered technical challenges. Give Jon a codebase in which he has not previously worked, and he will sort it out and be producing with it in very short order. He is very aware of current and emerging technologies, but applies them to solutions in a sensible manner (rather than using personal interest as a primary motivator).'

    reference: 'Jon is one of the best developers I had pleasure to work with. He is passionate about what he is doing and never cuts corners. Never afraid to raise his concerns and propose the best solution for given problem. I have learned a lot from him and think he is going to be a great addition to any team.'
  - name: 'Corky Kaericher - CTO - Socialtopias'
    reference: "Itâ€™s rare that you come across standout talent and mind like Jon's. I hired Jon as a front end web developer and he is quite skilled in this area. Jon always has a handle on the latest available technologies and tools and went beyond his role as developer to also help out other team members with other aspects of our tech stack outside the front end web application development arena. He is also masterful with git version control tools, which helped a lot as our project was ramping up and we were creating the internal tools and processes to get things done. Jon is punctual and reliable too. Jon would be good on any web app team."
